# Toolbox

This is a collection of tools that I use in my daily life. I have created this repository to keep track of the tools that I use and to share them with others. I hope you find them useful.

## Install_docker.sh

This script installs Docker on Ubuntu. It is a simple script that installs Docker using the official Docker installation script.

```bash
bash ./install_docker.sh
```
